# Problem

**Breaking into the UI/UX design is difficult for many newcomers.** Few universities offer degrees in this field. Online resources, while abundant, can be challenging to navigate. 

<aside>
üí° By better supporting UI/UX design beginners, we can bring more qualified designers into the workforce.

</aside>

# Goal

In this research project, I aim to answer two research questions:

1. **What problems and challenges are UI/UX designers facing when starting their career?**
2. **How might an online platform support novice designers in starting their career?**

# Research plan

![Untitled](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled.png)

I used four research methods in this project: interview, survey, focus group, and card sort. The interview, survey, and focus group were conducted to achieve a triangulated understanding of the target users‚Äô problems, needs, and required features for the platform. The card sort was used to study how users would organize the features of the platform.

<aside>
üìù When planning the research, I had to consider the purpose of each method as well as their information flow, i.e. how findings of one method inform the planning of the next.

</aside>

# Interview

## Activity plan

I interviewed 2 aspiring designers with no professional experience. The interviews were explorative and semi-structured. I chose the interview as the first activity because it granted me the freedom to explore the problem space. 

## Findings

![Untitled](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled%201.png)

1. What are their challenges?

Both interviewees experienced trouble in developing certain skills, especially in user testing and research. Building a portfolio is another challenge. The interviewees struggled with knowing what to do for a project and showcasing the projects. One also mentioned working alone as a challenge.

> *‚Ä¶I don't know what to showcase. Does the person who want to see the portfolio, do they like just images or do they like videos?‚Ä¶*
> 
1. How are they solving them?

The interviewees primarily use online resources for developing their skills. They learned on platforms such as YouTube and Coursera and went to Behance for inspiration. One person also used their network for obtaining design feedback and learning about the industry.

> *I also went to some career day fairs [‚Ä¶] talked to them, see what skills they need, what I have and try to evaluate my position‚Ä¶*
> 

# Survey

## Activity plan

After collecting some initial findings through the interviews, I ran a survey to see how the findings would hold for a larger population of users. The survey was sent to two university group chats of people who are interested in UI/UX or majored in Interaction Technology/HCID.

<aside>
üëéüèº The survey has a low response rate with only 6 responses. This is likely due to the high effort required to complete. Simplifying the survey and sending it personally to each respondent may improve the response rate.

</aside>

## Findings

With only 6 responses, I decided to treat the results as additional feedback instead of statistically significant data.

1. What are their challenges?

![Respondents rate the difficulty a list of problems on a 5-point Likert scale. This graph summarizes the result.](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled%202.png)

Respondents rate the difficulty a list of problems on a 5-point Likert scale. This graph summarizes the result.

Overall, the most significant challenges involve the portfolio (building and showcasing projects) and networking (finding participants for research and testing, team members for projects, and networking with other designers).

1. How are they solving them?

![Respondents rate the usefulness of a list of problems on a 5-point Likert scale. This graph summarizes the result.](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled%203.png)

Respondents rate the usefulness of a list of problems on a 5-point Likert scale. This graph summarizes the result.

YouTube is considered the most helpful resource. Friends and connections were also rated highly. Social media is split, with one half considered it extremely useful while the other only slightly or not useful. Interestingly, Behance was rated among the least useful.

<aside>
üéì University studies were also rated very useful, but this might be biased by the fact that the sample were all Master‚Äôs students. A more diverse sample size would be better.

</aside>

# Focus group

## Activity plan

I organized a focus group with two purposes:

1. To gain deeper understanding of previous findings and find what are potentially missing
2. To generate ideas for the UI/UX design support platform

The focus group consists of 3 UI/UX designers with 1-3 years of experience. 

<aside>
üí¨ During the warm-up, I ask participants to share why they wanted to become designers. This helped people feel comfortable talking through sharing what they were passionate in and also led the discussion naturally into the main topics.

</aside>

## Findings

Elaborating on building a portfolio, one participant found the most challenging things to be knowing what kind of things he should describe in his case studies and to what details. On finding resources, another stated that he was faced with too much, and sometimes contradictory, online resources.

Since the participants had some experience, they could introduce additional challenges they encountered when starting their first position. These include using quantitative tools, communicating with stakeholders, and learning about development.

> *We lack collaboration skills when we are working as a beginner because maybe we just worked on [‚Ä¶] a personal project that have that didn't have teams like maybe developer, PM or business team.*

In the brainstorming session, the group came up with 17 ideas. These can grouped into topics such as portfolio building, community, basic resources, and practice resources.

# Card sort

## Activity plan

I conducted 2 card sort sessions to study how potential users would categorize the features of the platforms. These features include ideas from the focus group as well as my own ideas based on previous findings.

## Findings

Overall, there are clear patterns on how the participants sorted the features. However, there are also significant differences. For instance, one participant grouped portfolio-related features into a separate category while the other considered them part of Tutorials and Resources. The activities also revealed that the feature name ‚ÄúHands-on practice‚Äù was confusing and required explanation from the researcher.

# Conclusions

## Problems and challenges

![Untitled](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled%209.png)

- The most prevalent challenges concern building a portfolio: finding a suitable project idea, knowing what details to include in the projects, and showcasing the projects.
- Other significant challenges involve the community: networking, getting feedback, and finding project teammates and participants for research and testing.
- Junior designers also struggled with certain hard and soft skills. Some challenges in developing these skills include the difficulty of navigating online resources and the lack of opportunity to practice.

## Vision for the platform

![Untitled](How%20to%20support%20people%20in%20starting%20a%20UI%20UX%20design%20c%2098332b45aa49402784cab9baafa87ed4/Untitled%2010.png)

With the findings in mind, I drew up the initial vision for a platform to support UI/UX design beginners:

- The platform can host weekly/monthly UI/UX design challenges. The challenge prompts help participants have a clear idea of what they can do, what deliverables they must create, and what details they should include in the submission. Participants can then use these projects for their portfolio.
- The platform can have a space for showcasing portfolio projects. These project case studies should show the whole design process instead of just the end products. [Drawerr](https://drawerrr.com/ux-cases) is already serving a similar function. The platform can differentiate itself with features such as feedback through annotation, LinkedIn/Behance integration, and case studies building tools.
- To help people find the right content, the platform can curate freely available resources on the Internet into an easily-navigable catalogue. It can also offer a beginner guide and assessment quiz to help people plan their learning journey.
- Finally, the platform can include a forum for recruitment of collaborators or user research participants and other discussions. It can also allow people to search for professional Facebook/Discord communities, offline events, and meetups in their vicinity.

# Next steps

- Do more research on the use of social media, organization of platform features, and other points.
- Further design each feature with an iterative, human-centered process.
- Develop an MVP with the design challenge feature. Continue to introduce other features as the platform grows.

# Key learnings

- Research planning: how to choose and plan methods in a way that helps me answer my research questions.
- The dos and don‚Äôts of different user research methods.
- Improve my skills as an interviewer and activity facilitator.
